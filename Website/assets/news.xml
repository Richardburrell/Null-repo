			Major: Computer Science <br><br>
			Proficiency: C++ Programming Language <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ryan is a nerd most of the time and possibly the coolest guy you will ever meet. He loves long walks on the beach and even longer talks about the wonderful world of computer programming. He will one day rule the world with a hostile take over via lawn mowing/vacuum robots. He came to the syntax ciphers because Matt picked on him in math class untill he did.

		<description><![CDATA[<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; While Deandre Howard, an electrical engineer and lineman, was repairing a power line, a freak lightning accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living electrical capacitor. His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by Magneto, who considered him a potential recruit for his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, claiming that Howard's power rivaled his own, but Howard refused. He then joined the Syntax Ciphers and brought his talents to their endeavors.]]></description>
